## Introduction

The **Kintex 7 MIPI DSI 1.32" LCD** is designed for applications that require a compact and efficient display solution. The MIPI DSI (Display Serial Interface) protocol provides a high-speed connection, making it ideal for mobile and embedded applications. This repository includes HDL code, example designs, and documentation to help you integrate the LCD into your projects seamlessly.

## Features

- **High Resolution**: 1.32-inch display with a resolution of 240x240 pixels.
- **MIPI DSI Interface**: Fast and efficient communication with the display.
- **FPGA Compatibility**: Specifically designed for Xilinx Kintex 7 FPGAs.
- **Easy Integration**: Well-documented HDL code and examples.
- **Command Set Support**: Comprehensive command set for display control.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Kintex 7 MIPI DSI 1.32" LCD, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/STARLORD-ugh/Kintex-7-MIPI-DSI-1.32-inch-LCD.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change into the project directory:
   ```
   cd Kintex-7-MIPI-DSI-1.32-inch-LCD
   ```

3. **Check the Releases**: Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/STARLORD-ugh/Kintex-7-MIPI-DSI-1.32-inch-LCD/releases) section to download the latest release. Download the necessary files and execute them as needed.

## Hardware Requirements

To successfully implement this project, you will need the following hardware:

- **Xilinx Kintex 7 FPGA Board**: Ensure you have a compatible board.
- **1.32-inch MIPI DSI LCD Display**: Make sure it supports the MIPI DSI interface.
- **Power Supply**: Provide the necessary voltage and current for the display and FPGA.
- **Connecting Wires**: Use appropriate wires to connect the display to the FPGA.

## Software Requirements

You will need the following software tools:

- **Xilinx Vivado**: For synthesizing and programming the FPGA.
- **Verilog**: This project uses Verilog for HDL design.
- **ModelSim**: For simulation and verification (optional but recommended).

## Installation

1. **Install Xilinx Vivado**: Download and install Xilinx Vivado from the [Xilinx website](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html).

2. **Install ModelSim**: If you choose to simulate your design, install ModelSim from the [ModelSim website](https://www.mentor.com/products/fpga/model-sim/).

3. **Clone the Repository**: Follow the instructions in the Getting Started section.

4. **Open the Project in Vivado**: Launch Vivado and open the project file included in this repository.

5. **Synthesize the Design**: Use Vivado to synthesize the design and generate the bitstream.

6. **Program the FPGA**: Load the generated bitstream onto your Kintex 7 FPGA.

## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary software and programmed your FPGA, you can start using the LCD. The example designs included in this repository demonstrate how to initialize the display and send commands.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize the LCD:

```verilog
module lcd_init (
    input wire clk,
    output reg [7:0] data,
    output reg cmd
);
    initial begin
        // Send initialization commands to the LCD
        cmd = 1; // Command mode
        data = 8'h01; // Example command
        // More initialization commands...
    end
endmodule
```

## Command Set

The command set for the LCD is crucial for controlling its functions. Below are some common commands:

| Command | Description                       |
|---------|-----------------------------------|
| 0x01   | Clear display                     |
| 0x02   | Return home                      |
| 0x03   | Entry mode set                   |
| 0x04   | Display on/off                   |
| 0x05   | Set cursor position               |

For a complete list of commands, refer to the documentation included in the repository.
